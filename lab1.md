1 Does Your Processor Support Virtualization?
Most modern Intel and AMD processors support virtualization (Intel VT-x or AMD-V). If it’s disabled, you can turn it on in the BIOS settings.

2 Why is the Cloud So Popular?
The cloud has taken off because it’s scalable, cost-effective, and easy to access from anywhere.

Pros:

Saves money on hardware
Can scale up or down as needed
Reliable with built-in backups
Cons:

Security risks since data is stored off-site
Downtime if the provider has an outage
Hard to switch providers once you're locked in

3 What Does a Hypervisor Do?
A hypervisor lets multiple virtual machines (VMs) run on one physical computer by managing hardware resources.

4 What is a Virtual Machine?
A VM is a software-based computer that runs its own operating system, separate from the host machine.

5 Why Use Virtual Machines?
Makes better use of hardware
Keeps systems isolated from each other
Easy to back up or restore
Can run different operating systems on the same computer
Can be moved between machines easily

6 Five Ways Virtual Machines Are Used
Powering cloud services like AWS and Azure
Testing software in different environments
Cybersecurity research in a safe space
Running old applications on new hardware
Disaster recovery with quick backups

7 What is the Guest Operating System?
b) The operating system installed on a virtual machine

8 What is Virtual Machine Isolation?
c) Virtual machines run independently and are isolated from each other and the host system.

9 Why Does VM Portability Matter?
c) It allows virtual machines to be moved between different physical machines with compatible hypervisors.

10 Why Clone a Virtual Machine?
Cloning makes an exact copy of a VM, which is useful for testing, setting up multiple identical systems, or keeping a backup.
